        tired more than ever, poor
        shy Elmer, one of Santa’s helper-elves, began climbing into his top bunk-
        bed bed when a paper
        stuck in his sleeve fluttered at his wrist. Uh-oh. He checked. Uh-oh. A list of toys he’d
        forgotten to pack up in Santa’s sleigh. A mother had written and mailed to Santa the list
        for some children at the homeless shelter, a place families go when they can’t stay in their own
        home any more and don’t have any place else to go. Staying there means they don’t have
        much room, and usually can’t bring more than just one little toy.

Elmer crumpled down on the floor and wanted to cry, because nothing hurts and saddens and breaks a helper-elf’s heart more than not making a child happy.  And sometimes they just can’t.  Poor Elmer felt so terrible he didn’t even want to think about it, and after a few minutes of feeling sad and horrible and not liking himself at all, the tired, exhausted little helper elf nodded off to sleep.
