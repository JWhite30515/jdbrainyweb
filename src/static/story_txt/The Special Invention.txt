“Get dressed and come to breakfast right now!”  Mom called sweetly.  
	“I will,” [A-2] said.
	“You said that twice already!  You’ll make me late for work.”
	“Okay!”  [A-2]  said.	
	Great ideas kept [A-2]  thinking till late at night, so every morning it was hard to wake up in time for school.  
	[A-2]  liked inventing things, and they always worked really well---while [A-2]  was planning and imagining them---and sometimes almost worked after[A-2] actually made them.  A funnel to toss toys in like the [B-10] and the C-10] so they’d slide into the toy box to save time cleaning up.  A squirt-gun scraper to scrape dog poop off shoes and wash them at the same time.  A special second string so a kite could drop a little parachute holding a toy [D-3_5_6_7_8_10_11_13].
	Interesting inventions.  Helpful inventions!  Wonderful inventions!!
	[A-2]  needed a special stay-up-after-wake-up-in-the-morning invention. 
	[A-2]  thought about the [E-5_6_7_8_9_10_11] part all through breakfast, and cogitated about the [G-5_6_7_8_9_10_11] section on the way to school, and devised the [J-13] unit at school, and imagined the [K-5_6_7_8_9_10_11] segment on the way home, and by after school snack time knew the [L-5_6_7_8_9_10_11]  made the final step and then knew exactly how to create it!
	Every morning on her way to the kitchen Mom opened the bedroom door to politely say, “Wake up!”
	[A-2]  tied a string to the door knob, so when the door opened it would drop a toy [E-5_6_7_8_9_10_11]  on a teeter-totter lever tossing a toy [G-5_6_7_8_9_10_11] up in the air to flip over and land in a box on top of a toy [J-13]  that would tip to roll down a ramp and knock loose the [K-5_6_7_8_9_10_11]  hooked to the stopper on an old plastic bottle filled with water that would start slowly trickling into a bucket
												[2]
 with its handle rubber-banded to a stick taped to a toy  [L-5_6_7_8_9_10_11]  taped to a sharp pin on the end that would swing up to smack and pop a balloon that would for sure startle awake even sleepy [A-2].
	Who could sleep after creating such a magnificatious, splendificatory, brilliastonishing, phenomitastic invention?! Not [A-2], not until very late.  
Too late.
	[A-2]   didn’t wake when Mom opened the door and gently suggested, “Wake up!”  Didn’t notice the toy [E-5_6_7_8_9_10_11] dropping on the teeter-totter lever that tossed the toy [G-5_6_7_8_9_10_11] up into the air to flip and land on the [J-13] so hard that it slipped off the track but still bumped the [K-5_6_7_8_9_10_11] loose, only smacking the stopper so hard the water didn’t trickle out but shot out like a squirt gun and soaked a toy stuffed [N-5_6_7] on the edge of the shelf that got so wet heavy it fell on the cat that startled and screeched and leaped up high and knocked its hindquarters into the  [L-5_6_7_8_9_10_11]  so the pin sharp stung the cat’s tail and it howled and claw snatched at the balloon that loud-popped scaring the cat to twist land slap on guess-whose  sleeping face.
	[A-2]  swiped the cat away and jolted straight up and looked at the disrupted contraption— and thought: “Even if everything didn’t go exactly perfectly according to plan, my stay-up-after-wake-up-in-the-morning invention worked!”  And it did!
