Do you like wearing costumes and pretending to be somebody different?  The spelling kids really do, and enjoyed the goofiest, silliest, craziest, wackiest mixed-up costume party -- ever!  And had their pets dress up too!  The only rule was—no … scary … costumes.  Some kids dressed like a [X-1_3_5_6_7] or [Y-1_3_5_6_7]  or [Z-1_3_5_6_7], but the spelling kids shared and traded different costume parts so their pets all looked really strange and weird and kind of especially — wondersome!  Except — [C-2 (audio only)] didn’t plan to mean to intend to break the rule, or be really naughty, just maybe a tiny bit mischievous, so [C-2] convinced [C-2]  it would be okay if the costume wasn’t scary all by itself, only just scary if people decided to be frightened, and if people decided to, [C-2]  decided that [C-2] wasn’t to blame.  Uh-hunh.  
	[D-2 (audio only) went to the party dressed as a [D-1-3], and brought a pet [E-H] who looked very interesting with a [E-M]  body and a [E-T] tail.
	[G-2] came costumed as a [G-1-3], and had a pet [J-H] who looked great with a [J-T]  tail and a [J-M] middle.  
	[K-2] thought and wondered and cogitated and finally decided to be a [K-1-3], and brought a strange pet [L-H] with [L-M] tummy parts and a [L-T] tail part. 
	And a wonderful time was had by all — until [C-2]   appeared in a Bigfoot Sasquatch costume!

	Which didn’t scare [D-2] or [G-2] or [K-2] —they didn’t decide to be frightened—but those poor pets didn’t know they could decide, and just got howlishously scared without even thinking about it!  The [E-H E-M E-T]  spilled the fruit punch bowl and the [J-H J-M J-T] tumbled into the big party chocolate angel-food cake and the [L-H L-M L-T] knocked over the treats table and in all the commotion [D-2] hid behind the [N-8_9], and [G-2] peeeeked out of the [P-8_9],  and [K-2]  sneaked under the [Q-8_9], and when the grown-ups rushed in [C-2]  thought it was a very good time to hide in a costume, only maybe not in a Bigfoot Sasquatch costume.  And the grownups made [C-2]  keep that costume on and do all the work all alone to wipe up the fruit punch and clean up the spilled cake and tidy up the treats table.  And [C-2]   decided not to decide again that it would be okay fun to decide to scare anybody, whether they decided to be scared or not.
